# PolicyLens - Regulatory Intelligence for RBI & SEBI

Regulatory research often means finding one operative clause across long RBI and SEBI circulars. PolicyLens provides a chat workspace to ask questions, inspect document/page citations and continue research in saved conversations.

The engineering focus is **whether the right evidence reaches the model**: retrieval is benchmarked, candidates are reranked, citations are checked, and traces expose failures behind a fluent answer.

- **Research:** source-grounded answers, readable citations and an evidence-based refusal gate.
- **Application:** registration/login, authenticated chat, saved sessions and follow-up questions.
- **Diagnostics:** optional Langfuse traces, stage latency, token usage and estimated cost.

**Stack:** React/TypeScript/Tailwind, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Sentence Transformers, Groq and LangChain LCEL. RAGAS provides partial judge evaluation. **Verified locally; not deployed.**

## Results at a glance

| Measurement | Recorded result | Sample and context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development Recall@5 | **85.61% dense -> 92.93% BM25 + BGE** | Same 41 answerable development questions; final top 5 |
| Frozen hold-out Hit@5 | **80% (8/10)** | Ten answerable questions in the 12-question hold-out |
| Manual answer review | **12 full, seven partial, one failure** | 20 selected development questions; human review |

Recall measures **retrieved gold-page coverage, not answer accuracy**. The small hold-out and selected manual sample limit generalization. [Benchmarks and source artifacts](docs/benchmarks/FINAL_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md) separate retrieval, answer review and partial RAGAS scores.

## How it works

```text
PDFs -> page extraction -> section-aware chunks -> Qdrant indexes
React -> FastAPI/JWT -> optional follow-up rewrite
      -> BM25 top 20 -> BGE top 5 -> gate/context budget
      -> Groq -> citation check -> answer and sources
         PostgreSQL sessions | optional Langfuse traces
```

The API retrieves public documents only. Cached `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` selects five chunks; the highest score must reach **0.60**. Groq `openai/gpt-oss-120b` uses prompt **v1**, temperature 0, **7,680 input tokens** and a **1,024-token completion cap**, including reasoning. Both prompt versions remain available. Citations verify supplied document/page membership, not claim support; follow-ups use bounded history and fresh retrieval.

## Engineering challenges and lessons

- **Evidence selection - G003:** The RBI Payments Banks amendment's page 2 was BM25 rank 8, then reranker rank 12: it never reached generation. Local metadata enrichment moved it to rank 1, but the 41-question experiment also regressed other questions. **Not deployed:** aggregate gains did not establish a safe replacement. [Experiment details](docs/benchmarks/FINAL_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md#metadata-enrichment-experiment-not-deployed).
- **Citation formatting:** G012/G017 had correct answers but whitespace variants escaped parsing. The regex was corrected and manually verified; original benchmark labels remain partial passes.
- **Abstention contract:** Not-found text could carry `abstained=false`. Final-response normalization is implemented; offline tests cover model refusal/source preservation. A successful post-fix end-to-end API retest remains unverified.

## Run locally

Prerequisites: Python 3.10+, Vite-compatible Node.js (for example 22.16), Docker, Groq credentials and a prepared BM25-capable Qdrant index. PowerShell, from the repository root:

### 1. Backend and services

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev,api,groq]"
if (-not (Test-Path .env)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env }
docker compose up -d postgres qdrant
```

In `.env`, replace the mock default with `POLICYLENS_LLM_PROVIDER=groq`, set `POLICYLENS_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b` and your `POLICYLENS_GROQ_API_KEY`. Configure database connections; Compose exposes PostgreSQL on **5433**, Qdrant on **6333**. Keep secrets out of Git.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
$env:POLICYLENS_JWT_SECRET = & .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn policylens.api.app:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Keep a stable signing secret for deployment. Docker does **not** populate Qdrant: the ingest CLI writes dense chunks; BM25 needs separate backfill/index preparation. See [ingestion setup](docs/rag_notes.md#ingestion-and-indexing). First-request model loading adds latency.

### 2. Frontend - another terminal

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
if (-not (Test-Path .env.local)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env.local }
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The frontend example sets `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`; backend routes have no prefix. CORS allows `http://localhost:5173`; configure other explicit origins through `POLICYLENS_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. [Frontend details](frontend/README.md).

### 3. API and verification

[Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) lists 13 operations. Auth, chat, sessions, `/health` and `/ready` work; feedback, document/PDF and admin workflows return 501. Chat returns JSON. Readiness returns 503 when PostgreSQL/Qdrant is unavailable.

Checks: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q` and `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check .`; in `frontend/`, `npm run build` and `npm run lint`. Recorded regression (2026-11-01): **541 passed, two live-model tests skipped; Ruff passed.** Not rerun for this editorial update.

Measured request p50 was **8.23 seconds** across 24 completed sequential requests (20 benchmark + four earlier); reranking dominated. Total excludes logging/network delivery. This is not a concurrency test or production SLA. Optional `.[tracing]` uses Langfuse settings in [.env.example](.env.example); chat continues if tracing fails. [Query-log reporting](scripts/query_log_report.py) summarizes timings and estimated cost, not invoices.

## Scope and limitations

- Argon2id/JWT authentication and owner-scoped sessions; tokens stay in memory. No refresh-token revocation/rotation, complex RBAC or persistent browser login.
- **10 chat requests/user/60 seconds**, with `Retry-After`; counters reset on restart and are not shared across workers.
- Multi-page coverage, irrelevant evidence and incomplete/truncated answers remain failure modes. Metadata enrichment and page diversity are not production features.
- Full RAGAS evaluation is paused. No OCR or streaming. Delimiters, citation checks and redaction do not guarantee security or factual correctness.
